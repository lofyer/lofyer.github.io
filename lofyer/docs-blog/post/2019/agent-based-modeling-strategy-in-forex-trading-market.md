## PREFACE

Since I've tested S1, S2, and S3 from the [DATANOTE](https://datanote.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/). However, it was not so good or in other words, identical with expectation. It's time to make a change.

## BASIC MODEL AND ARCHITECTURE

As you can see from my last articles, [the architecture's infrastructure](https://blog.lofyer.org/the-forex-quantum-trade-system-and-infrastructure/) is about to go and the [agent's protocol](https://blog.lofyer.org/%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8E%E5%A4%96%E6%B1%87%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E6%8C%87%E6%A0%87%E7%9A%84abm%E5%BB%BA%E6%A8%A1/) is well defined. Now what we should do is to combine them together.

In the first phase, the simulation will JUST be a Netlogo program. If the performance is just like S1-3, then it goes to phase 2 ---- treating the agents as the real from the data gained and strategy trained from the real world. And if NOT, less probable, the program must be corrected.
