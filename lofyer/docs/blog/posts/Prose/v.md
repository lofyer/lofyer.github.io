Remember, remember

The 5th of November 要记住，要记住，11月的5日

The gunpowder treason and plot 火药阴谋和叛乱

I know of no reason Why the gunpowder treason Should ever be forgot 我不知有何理由可以忘记火药阴谋

We are told to remember the idea and not the man 我们被教导要记住思想，不是人

Because a man can fail He can be caught, he can be killed and forgotten 因为人可能失败 他可能会被捕 他会被杀死、被遗忘

But 400 years later......an idea can still change the world 但400年后思想仍可改变世界

I have witnessed firsthand the power of ideas. 我亲眼目睹了思想的威力

I've seen people kill in the name of them... 我见过人们以它为名杀戮

...and die defending them 为维护它而送命

But you cannot kiss an idea......cannot touch it or hold it 但你不能杀死思想不能触到它或者捧着它

Ideas do not bleed. They do not feel pain. 思想不会流血，不会感到痛苦 思想不会死去

They do not love.他们不会爱

And it is not an idea that I miss 但我最思念的不是思想

It is a man A man that made me remember the 5th of November. 是一个男人，让我记住11月5日的男人

A man that I will never forget. 一个我永不会忘记的男人

That with devotion's visage and pious action we do sugar o'er the devil himself. 人们往往用至诚的外表和虔敬的 行动，掩饰一颗魔鬼般的

Who is but the form following the function of what......and what I am is a man in a mask. 我是谁？名字只是事物的代号而已 而我是一个戴面具的人

I'm merely remarking upon the paradox of asking a masked man who he is. 我不过是指出一个矛盾， 需要问一个戴面具的人是谁吗？

But on this most auspicious of nights......permit me then, in lieu of the more commonplace sobriquet......to suggest the characterof this dramatis persona. 这样一个美好的夜晚请允许我建议用更平常的语言来介绍一位戏剧性的角色

In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran......cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity... ...is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified... ...and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice... ...and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengeance, a vendetta... ...held as a votive not in vain, for the value and veracity of such... ...shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose. So let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you......and you may call me V. 一位谦虚的杂耍老手代苦难命运的受害者和加害者演出这个面孔，不只是虚华的外表它是遗存的人民呼声 现已空洞消亡 不过，我这对过往烦恼的勇敢访问者 恢复了生命的活力 决心铲除那些引来 腐败堕落邪恶的毒虫 遏制他们狂暴的恶毒的 以及贪婪的对意志的破坏 对他们唯一的裁决就是复仇 正义和警惕的信念不会落空 它们的价值和真理终将实现 当然，我这段莫名其妙的杂碎汤 带来的是最冗长的自我介绍 所以简单地说，能遇见您 是我很大的荣幸，请叫我V

They are perspectives. So if you've seen nothing......if the crimes of this government remain unknown to you......then I would suggest that you allow the 5th of November to pass unmarked. 它们是人的权利所以如果你什么也没看见 对这个go-vern-ment犯下 的罪行一无所知 我建议你让这个 11月5日平淡地过去

But if you see what I see......if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek......then I ask you to stand beside me,one year from tonight......outside the gates of Parliament. 可是如果你看见我所见的如果你有跟我一样的感受如果你像我一样去寻觅 我请你在一年以后的今晚站到议会大厦的外面 团结一致，我们将使11月5日 永远不会被忘怀
