Travelers, it is late. Life's sun is going to set. During these brief days that you have strength,be quick and spare no efforts of your wings.

 

Denial

Feeling lonely and ignoble indicates that you haven't been patient.

Friendship and loyalty have patience as the strength of their connection.

 

Anger

The undisciplined person doesn't wrong himself alone... but sets fire to the whole world.

With will, fire becomes sweet water.

 

Bargaining

Be observant if thou wouldst have a pure heart, for something is born to thee in consequence of every action.

 

Depression

Dear soul, if you were not friends with the vast nothing inside, why would you always be casting your net into it, and waiting so patiently?

You were born with wings.Why prefer to crawl through life?

 

Acceptance

Only from the heart can you touch the sky.

Let the beauty of what you love be what you do.

 

This is love: to fly toward a secret sky, to cause a hundred veils to fall each moment. First to let go of life, to take a step without feet.
